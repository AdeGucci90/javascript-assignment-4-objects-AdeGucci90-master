```

## ‚úÖ Tasks

Please **_do not edit any other file_** except those specified here.
The assignment tasks are as follows:

#### **1. Object Properties**

-   In the `objectProps.js` file, write a JavaScript function that:

    -   Takes in an object as an argument.
    -   Deletes any properties whose values are not strings.
    -   Adds a property called `length` and sets its value to the new length of the object.
    -   Tranforms the object property names to uppercase.

-   The name of your function must be `objectProps`.
-   The function must take 1 argument corresponding to the object to be transformed: `obj`.
-   The function must `return` the transformed object.
-   Here is an example of the expected output when `console.log(objectProps({ name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" }))` is called:

```bash
{
  NAME: 'John',
  CITY: 'New York',
  LENGTH: 2
}
```

-   **_Hint:_** Look up the [toUpperCase method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase).
-   **_Hint:_** Look up the [typeof operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof).
-   **_Hint:_** Look up the [delete operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete).
-   **_Hint:_** Look up the [for...in statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in).

#### **2. Object Methods**

-   In the `objectMethods.js` file, create an object called `person` with the following properties:

    -   `firstName` - String
    -   `lastName` - String
    -   `age` - Number
    -   `city` - String
    -   `skills` - Array
    -   `isMarried` - Boolean
    -   `fullName` - Function

-   The `fullName` function should return the full name of the person.
-   The `fullName` function should be a method of the `person` object.
-   Here is an example of the expected output when `console.log(person.fullName())` is called:

```bash
My name is John Doe.
```

-   **_Hint:_** Look up the [this keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this).

#### **3. Nested Objects**

-   In the `nestedObjects.js` file, create a function called `nestedObjects` that takes in an array as an argument and returns a nested object.
-   The name of your function must be `nestedObjects`.
-   The function must take 1 argument corresponding to the array to be transformed: `arr`.
-   The function must `return` a nested object.
-   For an array of length `n`, the nested object must have `n` levels.
-   For an empty array, the function should return `null`.
-   Here is an example of the expected output when `console.log(nestedObjects(["John", "Doe", 30, "New York"]))` is called:

```bash
{
    value: 'John',
    next: {
        value: 'Doe',
        next: {
            value: 30,
            next: {
                value: 'New York',
                next: null
            }
        }
    }
}
```

-   **_Hint:_** Look up [recursion](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/recursion-in-javascript-1608032c7a1f/).
-   **_Hint:_** Look up [linked lists](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/implementing-a-linked-list-in-javascript/).
-   **_Hint:_** Look up [Array.prototype.slice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice).
-   **_Hint:_** Look up [object references and copying](https://javascript.info/object-copy).

#### **4. Spread Syntax**

-   In the `spreadSyntax.js` file, write a JavaScript function that takes in two objects and enumerates their properties into one object.
-   The name of your function must be `spreadSyntax`.
-   The function must take 2 arguments corresponding to the objects to be enumerated: `obj1` and `obj2`.
-   The function must `return` an object containing the enumerated properties of `obj1` and `obj2`.
-   If the same property exists in both objects, the value of the property in `obj2` should be used.
-   Here is an example of the expected output when `console.log(spreadSyntax({ name: "John", age: 30 }, { city: "New York" }))` is called:

```bash
{
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  city: 'New York'
}
```

-   **_Hint:_** Look up [the Spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#spread_in_object_literals).

#### **5. Destructuring**

-   In the `destructuring.js` file, write a JavaScript function that takes in an object and returns an array containing the values of the object.
-   The name of your function must be `destructuring`.
-   The function must take 1 argument corresponding to the object to be destructured: `obj`.
-   The function must `return` an array containing the values of the `name` and `city` properties of the object.
-   If the `name` or `city` property does not exist, the value of the property in the array should default to `null`.
-   Here is an example of the expected output when `console.log(destructuring({ name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" }))` is called:

```bash
[ 'John', 'New York' ]
```

-   Here is an example of the expected output when `console.log(destructuring({ name: "John", age: 30 }))` is called:

```bash
[ 'John', null ]
```

-   Here is an example of the expected output when `console.log(destructuring({ age: 30, city: "New York" }))` is called:

```bash
[ null, 'New York' ]
```

-   Here is an example of the expected output when `console.log(destructuring({ age: 30 }))` is called:

```bash
[ null, null ]
```

-   **_Hint:_** Look up [Destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#object_destructuring).

#### **6. Histogram**

-   In the `histogram.js` file, write a JavaScript function that takes in a string and returns an object containing the histogram of the letters and numbers in the string.
-   The name of your function must be `histogram`.
-   The function must take 1 argument corresponding to the string to be analyzed: `str`.
-   The function must `return` an object containing the histogram of the letters and numbers in the string.
-   The function must ignore spaces, punctuation, and special characters.
-   The function must count uppercase and lowercase letters as the same letter.
-   The function should be able to handle an empty string i.e., `return {}`.
-   Here is an example of the expected output when `console.log(histogram("Hello World, 123!"))` is called:

```bash
{
    h: 1,
    e: 1,
    l: 3,
    o: 2,
    w: 1,
    r: 1,
    d: 1,
    1: 1,
    2: 1,
    3: 1
}
```

-   **_Hint:_** Look up [Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).
